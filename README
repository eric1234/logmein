A UI plugin that sits on top of authlogic to provide basic security
(i.e. restricted access to certain actions) and a login screen to allow
the user to get through security.

This of course ASSUMES your definition of a login system is the same as
ours. Here is what ours means:

* There is a login page at the URL /login
* There is a logout action at the URL /logout
* All actions are protected by default unless specifically stated by
  declaring a constant called PUBLIC_ACTIONS which is an array of
  public actions.
* If a protected action is hit the user will be redirected to the
  login page with the original location saved in the session variable
  :return_to.
* After login the user should be directed to root_url unless the session
  variable :return_to is set. In that case it redirects to the value
  of :return_to. 

What it does NOT provide:

* User management
* Registration
* Forgot My Password - See our related plugin called remindme
