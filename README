A UI plugin that sits on top of authlogic to provide basic security
(i.e. restricted access to certain actions) and a login screen to allow
the user to get through security.

This of course ASSUMES your definition of a login system is the same as
ours. Here is what ours means:

* There is a login page at the URL /login
* There is a logout action at the URL /logout
* All actions are protected by default unless specifically stated by
  declaring a constant called PUBLIC_ACTIONS which is an array of
  public actions.
* If a protected action is hit the user will be redirected to the
  login page with the original location saved in the session variable
  :return_to.
* After login the user should be directed to root_url unless the session
  variable :return_to is set. In that case it redirects to the value
  of :return_to.
* If session[:return_to] is blank (they went directly to /login) then
  redirect to "home_url" that the app needs to define in their routes

In addition this gem is model independent. This means the model does not
have to be called "User" (although that is the default and you must
inform this engine if it will be something else). It is limited to only
providing security for one model.

Note that you do not have to define the authenticated model itself
(i.e. User). If you do not the plugin will automatically dynamically
define a basic model for you. But if you do define the model you must
call the acts_as_authentic macro.

What it does NOT provide:

* User management
* Registration
* Forgot My Password - See our related plugin called remindme

This package is only compatible with Rails 3.x. If you are still on
Rails 2.x check out the 0.0.5 version of this gem.
