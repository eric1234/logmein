  # By default Authlogic assumes the session class is named based on the
  # class being authenticated (User -> UserSession). If an app does not
  # follow that assumption then the app must manually specify the
  # session class. Since our session class is simply called "Session" we
  # do not follow that default but we don't want every app to need to
  # specify this. So we override session_class to allow "Session" as the
  # default if "UserSession" cannot be loaded.
